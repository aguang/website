August Guang, Lead Genomics Data Scientist @ [Brown University's Computational Biology Core](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/computational-biology-of-human-disease/). Former collective member @ [Tooth&Nail](https://www.instagram.com/tooth.nailcollective/?hl=en) and @ [Free Radicals](https://freerads.org/).

I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics and Computational Biology from Brown University in 2017. My primary research interest is in quantifying uncertainty; my dissertation was on uncertainty in phylogenetic workflows with an application to HIV transmission inference. In a way, that is also my motivation and mantra in community organizing: becoming comfortable with uncertainty and always pushing for change.
